# This is a standard property that most window managers (including XMonad) support.

# XMonad workspace numbers are 0-based, so we add 1 to make them 1-based

# For a simple number:
# echo "$adjusted_workspace"

# Example with an icon and some xmobar formatting:
# echo "<fn=1>\xf111</fn> $adjusted_workspace"

# Get the current workspace name from xprop.
